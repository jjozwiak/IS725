ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves today claimed switch-hitting, five-time Gold Glove finalist OF Billy Hamilton off waivers from the Kansas City Royals. Additionally, the club optioned RHP Bryse Wilson to Triple-A Gwinnett, while recalling RHP Jacob Webb from the Stripers and placing him on the 60-day injured list with a right elbow impingement. The Colorado Rockies also claimed RHP Wes Parsons off waivers from Atlanta, after the Braves designated the righty for assignment on August 16. The Braves' 40-man roster is full. Hamilton, 28, spent the season with Kansas City, appearing in 93 games with the Royals and hitting .211 (58-for-275) with 18 stolen bases. The switch-hitter signed with the Royals last December after spending the first six seasons of his major league career with Cincinnati, where he was a five-time Gold Glove finalist in center field.
