The Washington Nationals agreed to terms on a two-year contract with right-handed pitcher Daniel Hudson on Tuesday. Nationals President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Mike Rizzo made the announcement. Hudson, 32, returns to Washington after going 3-0 with six saves and a 1.44 ERA in 24 games for the Nationals in 2019. He recorded the final out of Washington's World Series Championship run, striking out Houston's Michael Brantley to cap the 6-2 victory.
