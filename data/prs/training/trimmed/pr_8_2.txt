The Pittsburgh Pirates today signed outfielder Jarrod Dyson (pronounced jah-ROD) to a one-year contract for the 2020 season. The announcement was made by General Manager, Ben Cherington. Dyson spent the entire 2019 season with Arizona, where he recorded at least 30 stolen bases for the fifth time in his career while also establishing career highs in games (130), runs scored (65), hits (92), home runs (seven) and walks (47). The 35-year-old Dyson also recorded the second-best stolen base percentage (88.2) among all National League players in 2019 after being successful in 30 of his 34 stolen base attempts, trailing only Milwaukee's Christian Yelich (93.8). He finished third overall in the National League in stolen bases, while becoming just the sixth different player in Diamondbacks history to steal at least 30 bases in a single season.
