DETROIT The Detroit Tigers have agreed to terms with infielders Jonathan Schoop and C.J. Cron on one-year Major League contracts. Schoop, 28, played in 121 games with the Minnesota Twins in 2019, hitting .256/.304/.473 with 23 doubles, one triple, 23 home runs and 59 RBI. He hit 22 home runs as a second baseman, which was the fourth-highest total in all of baseball, while he ranked third with a .478 slugging percentage. The 6-1, 225-pound infielder had five multi-homer games during the season, which was tied for the second most by a second baseman in baseball history, trailing only Chase Utley, who had seven with Philadelphia in 2006.
