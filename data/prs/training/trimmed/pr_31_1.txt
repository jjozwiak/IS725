DETROIT The Detroit Tigers have agreed to terms with outfielder Cameron Maybin on a one-year Major League contract. Cameron is a dynamic outfielder that we can rely on for solid play in both the field and at the plate, said Al Avila, Detroit Tigers Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and General Manager. His veteran presence will be an asset to our lineup and weï¿½re excited to have him back with the organization.  Maybin, 32, began the 2019 regular season in the Cleveland Indians organization before being traded to the New York Yankees on April 25. In 82 games at the Major League level with the Yankees, Maybin hit .285/.364/.494 with 17 doubles, a career-high 11 home runs and 32 RBI.
