The Washington Nationals agreed to terms on a one-year contract with first baseman Ryan Zimmerman on Tuesday. Nationals President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Mike Rizzo made the announcement. Zimmerman, 35, returns to Washington after hitting .257 with nine doubles, six homers, 27 RBI, 17 walks and 20 runs scored in 52 games for the Nationals in 2019. He battled plantar fasciitis in his right foot, leading to two stints on the Injured List.
